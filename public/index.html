    <h1>The Ruby Workshop - April 28th 2012</h1>
    <p>So you want to learn Ruby??? Maybe you're familiar with other languages.
    Maybe you've never written a line of code in your life. Maybe you just want
    to see what all the fuss is about. In this interactive session, you'll learn
    some of the basic principles and practices of writing software with Ruby.
    You'll work on a simple application that uses freely available, civic data.
    By the end of the session, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to turn your code
    into a living, breathing, publicly accessible web app. </p>
